geeup is a command-line tool for batch uploading image and table assets to Google Earth Engine, designed for open source geospatial users. It is a minimal tool with a simple objective: to make it easy to upload and manage assets in Google Earth Engine. This tool borrows many features from the another project of mine [geeadd](https://geeadd.geetools.xyz) such as quota estimation before uploading new assets, task monitoring and cancellation to name a few of these tools.
